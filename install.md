###### RPM Installation
<a name="process" />
<p class="bitas" markdown= "1" >
GlideinWMS can be installed as RPM files. RPM files are distributed via Open Science Grid (OSG).    

Visit the links below to install.</p>

<p class="bitas" markdown= "1" style= "text-align:center">[VO Frontend Installation](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/other/install-gwms-frontend/)</p>

<p class="bitas" >The RPM Frontend installation will install the Frontend and its related components (User Pool & submit node).</p>

<p class="bitas" markdown= "1" style= "text-align:center">[Glidein Factory Installation](https://opensciencegrid.org/operations/services/install-gwms-factory/)</p>

<p class="bitas" markdown="1">The RPM Factory installation will install the factory and its related components (WMS Collector).  
These RPMs install a default version of the system but have the option to manually edit settings for more complicated configurations.  

Check the [Factory Configuration](/_pages/oldfiles/factory/configuration.html) or the [Frontend Configuration](/_pages/oldfiles/frontend/configuration.html) for more details on the configuration of the VO Frontend or glidein factories.</p>

<a name="configurations" />
###### Possible Layouts

<p class="bitas" markdown="1">The following are recommended configurations for installing
GlideinWMS.  If you are installing a Factory, note that
only configurations with the WMS Pool and Factory on the
same node are supported.  Also note that worker nodes must be able to
access the web server on the Factory and Frontend nodes in order to
download necessary files.
</p>
<p class="bitas" markdown="1">
Several possible layouts are:</p>

<p class="noheading" markdown="1">
**ONE SERVER LAYOUT**   
(USED ONLY FOR TEST INSTALLATIONS)        
</p>
<p class="bitas" markdown="1">
1. One node containing the GlideinWMS Pool, colocated Factory node, Glidein Frontend, glidein User pool, and the submit node for job submissions.  
 The Collector of the WMS Pool and the Collector of the User Pool will run on port 8618 and port 9618, respectively.  
With this configuration, take special care of the ports assigned and of the condor.sh currently sourced when running commands.
</p>  

<p class="noheading" markdown="1">
**TWO SERVER LAYOUT**   
(RECOMMENDED MINIMUM)        
</p>
<p class="bitas" markdown="1">
1. A node containing the GlideinWMS Pool and colocated glidein Factory  
2. A node containing the Glidein Frontend, glidein User Pool, and submit node
</p>

<p class="noheading" markdown="1">
**THREE SERVER LAYOUT**   
(RECOMMENDED FOR 1000+ GLIDEINS)        
</p>
<p class="bitas" markdown="1">
1. A node containing the glidein WMS Pool and colocated glidein Factory node.  
2. A node containing the glidein User Pool and the glidein Frontend.  
3. A node containing the submit node for user submissions.
</p>

<p class="noheading" markdown="1">
<a name="osg"/><b></b>

**OSG FACTORY LAYOUT**
</p>         
<p class="bitas" markdown="1">
Members of the Open Science Grid can use the OSG Factory at UCSD or GOC. In this case, they need to install only the [Glidein Frontend](/_pages/oldfiles/frontend/index.html).
See [OSG Glidein Factory](https://opensciencegrid.org/operations/services/install-gwms-factory/) for more details on how to use this setup to talk to the OSG Factory. You will also need a proxy for the Frontend to communicate and (at least) one proxy for the glideins for submission.
</p>

<p class="bitas" markdown="1">
It should be noted that it is no longer possible to install the GlideinWMS
  across administrative boundaries (i.e. you only install part
  of the GlideinWMS infrastructure) as tarball files are no longer supported.  
</p>

###### Upgrading Instructions
<p class="bitas" markdown="1">
